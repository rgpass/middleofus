      <p class="bio">Gerry had a useful idea for how he could hack the planet, but being short on time, he gave the idea to Chris and Amanda for their group project at General Assembly. After seeing what they could accomplish, he asked them if they wanted to remake it from scratch to continue their learning, and like that, MiddleOf.Us was born.</p>
